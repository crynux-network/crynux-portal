Bugfix protocol: First analyze the code to locate the root cause. Form a clear hypothesis and reproduce/validate it. Only after confirming the cause, implement a targeted fix. Do not apply speculative or blanket defensive changesâ€”keep the fix precise, minimal, and directly tied to the confirmed issue.
